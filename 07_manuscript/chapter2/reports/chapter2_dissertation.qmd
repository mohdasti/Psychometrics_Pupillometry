# Introduction

## Physical–Cognitive Dual-Task Interactions in Everyday Life and Aging

Everyday life frequently requires people to perform cognitively demanding tasks while simultaneously exerting physical effort. Surgeons must maintain continuous muscle engagement while making fine perceptual discriminations, athletes coordinate complex motor sequences while monitoring environmental cues, and older adults navigate dual-task situations—such as walking while monitoring traffic or carrying groceries while having a conversation—in which physical and cognitive demands interact dynamically. These real-world scenarios highlight a fundamental challenge: when multiple task domains compete for limited cognitive resources, performance in one or both domains may suffer [@wickens2008; @pashler1994dual]. This challenge takes on particular significance in aging, as older adults face both declining cognitive capacity and increased physiological costs of effortful engagement [@salthouse1996; @verhaeghen2003].

A growing literature suggests that physical–cognitive interactions are mediated by shared arousal systems, particularly the locus coeruleus–noradrenergic (LC–NE) system, which modulates sensory gain, evidence accumulation, and response caution as a function of task demands and internal state [@astonjones2005; @mather2016; @jepma2012neural]. Understanding how physical effort modulates cognitive performance—and how this relationship changes with age—requires moving beyond simple outcome measures (overall accuracy or mean reaction time) to characterize how effort-induced arousal alters the fundamental processes underlying perceptual decision-making. The present study addresses this question by combining a physical–cognitive dual-task paradigm with pupillometry and psychometric function analysis to examine how physical effort–induced arousal relates to perceptual sensitivity in older adults.

## Psychometric Functions: Quantifying Perceptual Sensitivity

### Theoretical Framework

Psychometric functions (PFs) provide a principled framework for characterizing how stimulus intensity relates to perceptual performance. Unlike summary statistics that collapse across stimulus levels, PFs model the complete intensity–response relationship, revealing how performance changes as stimulus differences become more or less discriminable. In a same–different discrimination task, the psychometric function maps continuous stimulus intensity (e.g., frequency offset or contrast difference) onto the probability of correctly detecting a difference or choosing "different" [@wichmann2001psychometric; @green1966signal].

### Mathematical Formulation

The psychometric function typically follows a sigmoidal (S-shaped) curve, most commonly modeled using the cumulative normal distribution (probit link) or logistic function (logit link). For binary choice tasks, the probit formulation is:

$$P(\text{"different"} | X) = \Phi\left(\frac{X - \alpha}{\beta}\right)$$ {#eq-psychometric}

where:
- $P(\text{"different"} | X)$ is the probability of choosing "different" given stimulus intensity $X$
- $\Phi(\cdot)$ is the cumulative standard normal distribution function (probit link)
- $\alpha$ is the **threshold** (point of subjective equality, PSE, or just noticeable difference, JND), representing the stimulus intensity at which performance reaches 50% (or other criterion level)
- $\beta$ is the **slope** parameter, representing the steepness of the function and inversely related to perceptual sensitivity: steeper slopes indicate higher sensitivity (smaller intensity differences are reliably detected)

Alternatively, using the logit link:

$$P(\text{"different"} | X) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp\left(-\frac{X - \alpha}{\beta}\right)}$$ {#eq-psychometric-logit}

### Key Parameters

**Threshold ($\alpha$ or PSE/JND):** The threshold parameter indicates the stimulus intensity at which participants perform at a criterion level (typically 50% "different" responses). A lower threshold indicates better sensitivity—participants can detect smaller stimulus differences. In aging research, threshold increases often reflect reduced perceptual sensitivity, requiring larger stimulus differences for reliable detection.

**Slope ($\beta$):** The slope parameter quantifies how rapidly performance improves as stimulus intensity increases. Steeper slopes indicate higher sensitivity and lower variability in perceptual judgments. Slope is inversely related to the standard deviation of the underlying sensory noise distribution: $\sigma = 1/\beta$ (for probit) or $\sigma = \beta \cdot \pi / \sqrt{3}$ (for logit). Age-related slope reductions suggest increased sensory noise or decreased discriminability [@green1966signal; @wichmann2001psychometric].

**Relationship to Signal Detection Theory:** The psychometric function is closely related to signal detection theory (SDT), where threshold corresponds to the decision criterion and slope relates to $d'$ (sensitivity). Changes in threshold reflect criterion shifts (response bias), while changes in slope reflect true sensitivity changes [@macmillan2005detection].

### Advantages Over Summary Statistics

Modeling continuous intensity–response relationships via PFs offers several advantages over collapsing trials into discrete "Easy/Hard" bins:

1. **Preserves information:** Continuous intensity is maintained rather than lost through binning, allowing more precise estimates of sensitivity changes.
2. **Parameter interpretability:** Threshold and slope have clear psychological and mathematical meanings, facilitating mechanistic interpretation.
3. **Statistical power:** Using all stimulus levels simultaneously provides more efficient parameter estimation than comparing discrete bins.
4. **Quantifies sensitivity changes:** Slope changes directly reflect how arousal alters the intensity–performance relationship, distinguishing true sensitivity effects from criterion shifts.

## Arousal, Effort, and Perceptual Performance

### Theoretical Perspectives on Arousal–Performance Relationships

The relationship between arousal and cognitive performance has been formalized in several influential frameworks. The **Yerkes–Dodson law** [@yerkes1908] posits an inverted-U function: performance improves with increasing arousal up to an optimal point, beyond which further arousal (especially stress or anxiety) impairs performance. **Adaptive Gain Theory (AGT)** [@astonjones2005] provides a neural mechanism linking phasic and tonic LC–NE activity to optimal task performance, with moderate tonic baseline and robust phasic bursts facilitating focused attention and rapid behavioral responses.

In the context of aging, this relationship becomes more complex. Research suggests that the arousal–performance curve may be altered in older adults, often manifesting as a **leftward shift or compression** of the inverted-U function [@mather2016; @mikneviciute2022]. This implies that older adults may reach their optimal arousal peak at lower levels of objective demand than younger adults. Consequently, levels of effort or stress that might be engaging or beneficial for younger adults (placing them at the peak of the curve) can push older adults onto the "descending limb," leading to **supra-optimal arousal** and performance decrements [@huang2024; @mather2016].

### Physical Effort as an Arousal Manipulation

Physical effort provides a powerful, controlled method for manipulating arousal state. Sustained isometric handgrip at moderate-to-high intensities (e.g., 30–40% of maximum voluntary contraction, MVC) elicits a robust pressor and sympathoexcitatory response—raising arterial pressure and heart rate and increasing sympathetic outflow—whose magnitude scales with contraction intensity and is preserved in older adults. At the neural level, static handgrip and postexercise ischemia recruit brainstem and cortical regions implicated in autonomic control and effort, providing a plausible central substrate for effort-induced shifts in arousal that can interact with perceptual decision processes [@mark1985; @toska2010; @lalande2014; @sander2010].

The **limited-capacity framework** [@wickens2008] predicts that concurrent physical effort should compete with cognitive tasks for shared processing resources, potentially degrading performance when demands exceed available capacity. Supporting this view, Azer et al. [-@azer2023] found that older adults showed significantly reduced accuracy in a visual working memory task while maintaining moderate handgrip (30% MVC), whereas younger adults remained unaffected. This suggests that the combined demand of physical and cognitive tasks may more easily deplete resources in older adults or drive arousal into a dysregulated state [@verhaeghen2003].

### Expected Effects on Psychometric Sensitivity

How should physical effort–induced arousal affect psychometric function parameters? Theoretical predictions vary:

**Threshold ($\alpha$) predictions:**
- If arousal degrades sensory signal quality or increases internal noise, thresholds should increase (larger stimulus differences required for reliable detection).
- If arousal optimizes neural gain at moderate levels, thresholds might decrease (better sensitivity).
- Supra-optimal arousal in older adults might shift thresholds upward, reflecting degraded signal-to-noise ratios.

**Slope ($\beta$) predictions:**
- Steeper slopes (higher sensitivity) would suggest that arousal enhances discriminability, perhaps by improving signal-to-noise ratios or sharpening neural tuning.
- Shallower slopes (lower sensitivity) would suggest that arousal introduces variability or noise, flattening the intensity–response relationship.
- The relationship may be non-linear: moderate arousal might enhance sensitivity (steeper slopes), while excessive arousal might flatten slopes (reduced discriminability).

## Pupillometry: A Window into Arousal Dynamics

### Locus Coeruleus–Norepinephrine System and Pupil Diameter

The LC–NE system serves as a central regulator of cortical arousal and cognitive state. This small brainstem nucleus is the primary source of norepinephrine to the forebrain and modulates the "neural gain" of cortical circuits—essentially the signal-to-noise ratio of information processing [@astonjones2005]. According to Adaptive Gain Theory, optimal performance relies on a balance between moderate tonic (baseline) LC firing that promotes focused attention and robust phasic (event-related) bursts that facilitate rapid behavioral responses to task-relevant stimuli [@gilzenrat2010].

**Pupillometry** provides a powerful, non-invasive window into these LC–NE dynamics. Pupil diameter tracks LC firing activity with high temporal precision [@joshi2016; @murphy2014], making it an ideal proxy for both tonic and phasic arousal states. The neural pathway linking LC to pupil diameter involves direct projections from LC to the Edinger–Westphal nucleus, which controls pupil constriction/dilation via parasympathetic and sympathetic pathways [@mcDougal2010].

### Pupil Metrics in Cognitive Tasks

Two primary pupil metrics capture distinct aspects of arousal:

**Baseline/Tonic Pupil Diameter:** Reflects tonic LC activity and general alertness levels [@gilzenrat2010; @alnaes2014pupil]. Larger baseline pupil diameter indicates higher tonic arousal, which may support sustained attention but can also reflect hyperarousal if excessive.

**Task-Evoked Pupil Response (TEPR):** Reflects phasic LC activation and the mobilization of mental effort during task execution [@beatty1982; @kahneman1966]. The TEPR typically peaks 1–2 seconds after stimulus onset and is quantified as:
- **Peak amplitude:** Maximum dilation relative to baseline
- **Area Under the Curve (AUC):** Integral of the baseline-corrected pupil signal over a time window, capturing both amplitude and duration of the response
- **Mean dilation:** Average pupil diameter over a fixed post-stimulus window

TEPR magnitude has been linked to task difficulty, cognitive load, surprise, and decision confidence [@preuschoff2011pupil; @vanbergen2021]. In discrimination tasks, larger TEPRs are associated with more difficult decisions, suggesting that phasic arousal signals the recruitment of cognitive control resources [@kiefer2018].

### Pupil–Cognition Links in Aging

In aging, the LC–NE system undergoes significant changes. Structural degradation of the LC is common in older adults [@mather2016], and functional compensatory mechanisms often emerge, such as chronically elevated tonic arousal or hyper-responsivity to challenge [@lee2018; @mather2016neural]. However, this compensation has limits: if older adults reach supra-optimal arousal states more readily, excessive norepinephrine release may lead to distractibility, indiscriminate processing, and performance decrements [@astonjones2005; @eldar2013].

Pupillometry studies in aging reveal complex patterns. Older adults often show larger baseline pupil diameters but reduced task-evoked responses, suggesting altered phasic–tonic balance [@granholm2007; @vanbergen2021]. Physical effort manipulations provide an opportunity to examine how externally induced arousal modulates these dynamics and whether effort-induced pupil changes predict cognitive performance changes.

## Dual-Task Paradigms and Resource Competition

### Theoretical Frameworks

Dual-task paradigms, in which participants perform two tasks simultaneously, have been central to understanding resource limitations and cognitive architecture. Several theoretical frameworks explain dual-task interference:

**Limited Capacity Model** [@kahneman1973; @wickens2008]: Posits that cognitive resources are finite and shared across tasks. When total demand exceeds capacity, performance suffers in one or both tasks.

**Resource Competition** [@navon1984; @navon1985]: Emphasizes that interference occurs when tasks compete for the same resource pool (e.g., both require attention or working memory).

**Multiple Resource Theory** [@wickens2008]: Proposes that interference depends on the similarity of resource requirements. Tasks using different resource dimensions (e.g., spatial vs. verbal) show less interference than tasks using similar dimensions.

### Physical–Cognitive Dual Tasks

Physical–cognitive dual tasks are particularly relevant for understanding real-world performance. When physical effort (e.g., maintaining handgrip force) is combined with cognitive tasks (e.g., perceptual discrimination), interference can arise from multiple sources:

1. **Shared attentional resources:** Both tasks require sustained attention and monitoring [@proctor2012].
2. **Physiological arousal:** Physical effort increases sympathetic activation, which may enhance or impair cognitive performance depending on arousal level [@silvestrini2008].
3. **Motor–cognitive interference:** Maintaining grip force may compete with response selection and execution processes [@woollacott2002].

Age-related changes in dual-task performance are well-documented, with older adults showing larger performance decrements under dual-task conditions [@verhaeghen2003; @beurskens2014]. This may reflect reduced cognitive reserve, impaired executive control, or altered arousal regulation.

### Reconciling Resource Competition and Arousal Mechanisms

The present study acknowledges that physical–cognitive dual-task interference may arise from both generic resource competition and arousal-mediated mechanisms. While resource competition models predict performance decrements when total demand exceeds available capacity, arousal-based frameworks (e.g., LC–NE system, Adaptive Gain Theory) predict that the *quality* of information processing may change as a function of arousal state, potentially independent of simple capacity limits. The current chapter focuses on arousal-mediated mechanisms because (a) pupillometry provides a direct index of LC–NE activity, allowing us to test arousal-specific hypotheses, and (b) the psychometric function framework enables us to distinguish sensitivity changes (arousal effects on signal quality) from criterion shifts (response strategy changes). However, effort main effects in the GLMM (capturing overall High vs. Low effort differences) may reflect both resource competition and arousal effects. If trial-wise pupil state does not significantly predict sensitivity beyond effort condition, this would suggest that resource competition or effort main effects (rather than moment-to-moment arousal fluctuations) are the primary drivers of performance changes. The chapter's focus on pupil–psychometric coupling is thus complementary to, rather than exclusive of, resource competition explanations.

## Linking Arousal to Psychometric Sensitivity: A Novel Approach

### Beyond Binned Analyses

Traditional approaches to examining arousal–performance relationships often collapse trials into discrete difficulty bins (e.g., "Easy" vs. "Hard"), losing information about continuous stimulus intensity. This binning approach assumes that arousal effects are uniform across intensity levels and cannot reveal how arousal modulates the intensity–response relationship itself.

### Within-Subject Centering: Separating State from Trait

A crucial methodological step in linking pupil metrics to performance is distinguishing **state** arousal (momentary fluctuations) from **trait** arousal (stable individual differences). To achieve this, we decompose each pupil metric $P_{ij}$—measured on trial $i$ for subject $j$—into within-subject (state) and between-subject (trait) components using within-subject centering:

$$P^{(\text{trait})}_{j} = \overline{P}_{j}, \qquad P^{(\text{state})}_{ij} = P_{ij} - \overline{P}_{j}$$ {#eq-state-trait}

where $\overline{P}_{j}$ is the subject's mean pupil metric across trials. Here, $P^{(\text{trait})}_{j}$ captures stable, subject-level differences in arousal (e.g., consistently larger baseline pupils or generally larger TEPRs), whereas $P^{(\text{state})}_{ij}$ captures trial-level deviations from that individual's mean (i.e., whether arousal on a given trial is higher or lower than usual for that person).

Including both components as predictors in the same model allows us to ask two distinct questions: (1) Do individuals with higher average arousal levels (trait) tend to show different psychometric sensitivity than those with lower average arousal? and (2) Within a given individual, do trials on which arousal is higher than their personal average show better or worse sensitivity? This decomposition avoids conflating between-person and within-person effects, a common problem in mixed data structures [@enders2013; @hoffman2015]. For example, if high-arousal individuals tend to have poorer performance for reasons unrelated to trial-wise fluctuations (e.g., underlying LC degeneration or comorbidities), that pattern will be captured at the trait level rather than falsely attributed to trial-wise changes in arousal.

### Hierarchical GLMM Framework

To formally test how arousal relates to psychometric sensitivity, the present study employs hierarchical generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) with a probit link. These models capture the binary decision outcome on each trial (e.g., "different" vs. "same" or correct vs. incorrect) as a function of continuous stimulus intensity, effort condition, modality, and pupil-indexed arousal, while also accounting for individual differences through random effects. The primary model can be written as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{probit}(P(Y_{ij}=1)) &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{ij} + \beta_2 \text{Effort}_{ij} + \beta_3 \text{Modality}_{ij} + \beta_4 P^{(\text{state})}_{ij} \\
&\quad + \beta_5 (X_{ij} \times P^{(\text{state})}_{ij}) + \beta_6 P^{(\text{trait})}_{j} + u_{0j} + u_{1j}X_{ij}
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-primary-glmm}


where $Y_{ij}$ is the binary outcome on trial $i$ for subject $j$ (e.g., a correct "different" response), and $X_{ij}$ is the continuous stimulus intensity on that trial. $\text{Effort}_{ij}$ codes the handgrip effort condition (High vs. Low), and $\text{Modality}_{ij}$ codes the sensory modality (auditory vs. visual). $P^{(\text{state})}_{ij}$ and $P^{(\text{trait})}_{j}$ are the state and trait components of the pupil metric, respectively, as defined above. The terms $u_{0j}$ and $u_{1j}$ are subject-specific random intercepts and random slopes on $X_{ij}$, allowing each participant to have their own baseline performance level and intensity sensitivity.

The **key interaction term** in this model is $X_{ij} \times P^{(\text{state})}_{ij}$, whose coefficient $\beta_5$ tests whether within-person fluctuations in arousal modulate psychometric sensitivity. A significant interaction would indicate that the slope of the intensity–response function depends on trial-level arousal: for example, high-arousal trials might show flatter or steeper psychometric curves than low-arousal trials, even after accounting for between-person differences in average arousal (via $P^{(\text{trait})}_{j}$). This hierarchical GLMM framework thus allows us to preserve the continuous nature of the stimulus dimension, rigorously separate state and trait arousal effects, and model individual differences in baseline sensitivity, while directly testing our central hypotheses about pupil–psychometric coupling in older adults.

## Research Questions and Hypotheses

Based on the theoretical frameworks and methodological considerations outlined above, the present study addresses the following research questions:

### Research Question 1: Behavioral Backbone

**RQ1:** How do High (40% MVC) versus Low (5% MVC) handgrip effort conditions alter psychometric function parameters (thresholds and slopes) in older adults performing auditory and visual same–different discrimination?

**Hypothesis 1a:** Thresholds will be higher (worse sensitivity) under High effort relative to Low effort, reflecting degraded signal-to-noise ratios from resource competition or supra-optimal arousal.

**Hypothesis 1b:** Slopes will be shallower (lower sensitivity) under High effort, indicating increased variability in perceptual judgments when arousal is elevated.

### Research Question 2: Effort–Pupil Manipulation Check

**RQ2:** Does High effort increase tonic and task-evoked pupil dynamics relative to Low effort in older adults?

**Hypothesis 2a:** Baseline (tonic) pupil diameter will be larger under High effort, indicating elevated tonic arousal.

**Hypothesis 2b:** Task-evoked pupil responses (TEPR, quantified as AUC) will be larger under High effort, indicating increased phasic arousal during task execution.

### Research Question 3: Pupil–Psychometric Coupling (Primary)

**RQ3:** Does trial-wise phasic arousal (pupil state) predict psychometric sensitivity when stimulus intensity is modeled continuously?

**Hypothesis 3a:** The interaction between stimulus intensity and pupil state ($X_{ij} \times P^{(\text{state})}_{ij}$) will be negative, indicating that higher trial-level arousal is associated with shallower psychometric slopes (reduced sensitivity). This would be consistent with supra-optimal arousal degrading signal quality or introducing noise.

**Hypothesis 3b (Alternative):** If moderate arousal enhances performance, the interaction might be positive, indicating steeper slopes (higher sensitivity) when arousal is elevated.

**Hypothesis 3c:** Pupil trait (between-subject baseline arousal) will show weaker or null associations with sensitivity, as trait effects may be confounded with other individual differences (e.g., LC integrity, cognitive reserve).

### Research Question 4: Subject-Level Individual Differences

**RQ4:** Do individuals with larger effort-evoked arousal changes (High–Low effort) also show larger effort-related changes in PF parameters?

**Hypothesis 4:** Subject-level changes in pupil metrics (Δpupil = High effort − Low effort) will be positively correlated with subject-level changes in thresholds (Δthreshold) and negatively correlated with changes in slopes (Δslope), indicating that individuals who show stronger physiological responses to effort also show larger behavioral sensitivity decrements.

# Methods

<!-- Add your methods section here -->

## Participants

Approximately 50 healthy older adults (target N ≈ 50 after QC; final N may vary modestly), aged 65+ years, completed the dual-task paradigm.

## Task Paradigm

Participants performed **same–different discrimination** tasks in two modalities while simultaneously squeezing a dynamometer:

**Effort Conditions:**

- **Low effort:** 5% of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC)

- **High effort:** 40% MVC

**Stimuli:**

- **Auditory Discrimination Task (ADT):** 1000 Hz base tones with frequency offsets of +8, +16, +32, or +64 Hz

- **Visual Discrimination Task (VDT):** Oriented Gabor patches with contrast differences of +0.06, +0.12, +0.24, or +0.48

**Trial Structure:**
Each trial followed this sequence:
1. Pre-squeeze baseline: 3 seconds
2. Sustained squeeze period: 3 seconds (Low or High effort)
3. Standard stimulus: 0.1 seconds
4. Inter-stimulus interval (ISI): 0.5 seconds
5. Target stimulus: 0.1 seconds
6. Response window: Participants indicated whether the target was "same" or "different" from the standard

## Pupillometry

Pupil diameter was recorded continuously throughout each trial using an eye-tracking system. The data were processed using a MATLAB preprocessing pipeline that segments trials relative to squeeze onset, flags blinks and track loss events, computes window-specific validity metrics, and implements baseline correction using pre-event windows.

### Pupil Features

Two primary features were computed on each trial:

1. **Total AUC:** Baseline-corrected area under the pupil curve over a global trial window, indexing overall arousal during concurrent physical effort.

2. **Cognitive pupil metric (primary):** Baseline-corrected task-evoked measure computed in a fixed-duration post-target window (e.g., from 300 ms after target onset through a fixed 1 s window), designed to reduce confounding by response time and late-trial dropout.

### Quality Tiers

Pupil-based analyses used pre-specified quality tiers:

- **Primary tier:** Window validity ≥ 0.60 for baseline and cognitive windows
- **Lenient tier:** Window validity ≥ 0.50 (robustness check)
- **Strict tier:** Window validity ≥ 0.70 (robustness check)

## Locus Coeruleus (LC) Integrity

### LC Integrity Quantification

For a subset of participants, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were available to quantify LC integrity. LC integrity was assessed using contrast-based metrics derived from magnetization transfer contrast (MTC) imaging, following the methodology described in Bennett et al. (2024, *Scientific Reports*). The primary LC integrity metric was computed as the mean MTC signal within the LC mask relative to the pons reference region (MTC~LC/pons~). This mean-within-mask approach was chosen over maximum-voxel extraction because it is more robust to uneven LC degeneration patterns that can affect maximum-voxel metrics [@bennett2024]. Additionally, diffusion-based metrics (e.g., restricted diffusion fraction) were available as complementary integrity indices, with prior work suggesting that diffusion metrics may relate to cognitive performance independent of age [@bennett2024].

### Conceptual Relevance

LC structural integrity provides a trait-level index of neuromodulatory capacity that complements the state-level (trial-wise) and trait-level (between-subject mean) pupil metrics. The LC–NE system serves as the primary source of norepinephrine to the forebrain and modulates cortical gain according to Adaptive Gain Theory [@astonjones2005]. Structural integrity of the LC may constrain both baseline (tonic) and task-evoked (phasic) LC–NE function, potentially explaining individual differences in arousal reactivity and its relationship to cognitive performance. In the context of Chapter 2's focus on pupil-indexed arousal and psychometric sensitivity, LC integrity may help explain why some individuals show stronger or weaker coupling between arousal state and perceptual sensitivity, beyond what is captured by pupil trait (mean arousal level).

### LC Integrity Analyses: Exploratory Extension

LC integrity analyses are positioned as **exploratory and secondary** to the primary pupil–psychometric coupling analyses specified in the prospectus. These analyses were motivated by the theoretical framework's emphasis on LC–NE mechanisms and by the recognition that trait-level pupil metrics (mean arousal) may be confounded with underlying LC structural integrity or other individual-difference factors (e.g., cognitive reserve, general health). However, because LC integrity data were not part of the original prospectus and are available for only a subset of participants, these analyses are treated as exploratory extensions that may inform future research rather than as confirmatory tests of primary hypotheses.

## Statistical Analysis

### Psychometric Function Fitting

Psychometric functions were fitted using probit link functions with continuous stimulus intensity as the predictor. Parameters (thresholds and slopes) were estimated separately for each subject × task × effort combination.

### Primary GLMM

The primary model used a probit link function to link phasic arousal to psychometric sensitivity:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{probit}(P(Y_{ij}=1)) &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{ij} + \beta_2 \text{Effort}_{ij} + \beta_3 \text{Modality}_{ij} + \beta_4 P^{(\text{state})}_{ij} \\
&\quad + \beta_5 (X_{ij} \times P^{(\text{state})}_{ij}) + \beta_6 P^{(\text{trait})}_{j} + u_{0j} + u_{1j}X_{ij}
\end{aligned}
$$


where $Y_{ij}$ is the binary choice on trial $i$ for subject $j$, $X_{ij}$ is continuous stimulus intensity, $P^{(\text{state})}_{ij}$ is the within-subject centered pupil metric (trial value - subject mean), and $P^{(\text{trait})}_{j}$ is the between-subject pupil metric (subject mean). The key interaction term $X_{ij} \times P^{(\text{state})}_{ij}$ (coefficient $\beta_5$) tests whether within-person fluctuations in arousal are associated with changes in psychometric sensitivity. The term $\beta_6 P^{(\text{trait})}_{j}$ tests whether between-subject differences in average arousal relate to sensitivity, while controlling for state-level effects. The random effects $u_{0j}$ and $u_{1j}$ allow each participant to have their own baseline performance level and intensity sensitivity, respectively.

### Sensitivity Analysis and Robustness Checks

To ensure the robustness of our primary findings, we conducted several sensitivity analyses:

**1. Quality Tier Robustness Checks**

The primary analysis used the primary quality tier (baseline and cognitive window validity ≥ 0.60). To assess whether results were sensitive to data quality thresholds, we re-ran the primary GLMM using two alternative quality tiers:

- **Lenient tier:** Window validity ≥ 0.50 (includes more trials, potentially with lower data quality)
- **Strict tier:** Window validity ≥ 0.70 (includes fewer trials, but with higher data quality)

If the key interaction effect (stimulus intensity × pupil state) is consistent across all three quality tiers, this provides evidence that the finding is robust to different data inclusion criteria.

**2. Model Comparison**

To evaluate whether the interaction term meaningfully improves model fit, we compared the primary model (with the stimulus intensity × pupil state interaction) to an alternative model that excluded the interaction term. Models were compared using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), where lower AIC values indicate better model fit. A substantial improvement in fit (ΔAIC > 2) for the model with the interaction would support the inclusion of this term and the interpretation that pupil state modulates psychometric sensitivity.

**3. Missingness Diagnostic**

As described in the Missingness Diagnostic section, we tested whether missing pupil data were systematically related to experimental conditions (effort, stimulus intensity, task) or behavioral measures (response time). If missingness is random or only related to non-experimental variables, this supports the validity of the primary analyses.

### Exploratory LC Integrity Extension

For participants with available LC integrity data, we extended the primary GLMM to examine whether LC structural integrity moderates the relationship between pupil-indexed arousal and psychometric sensitivity. The extended model includes:

$$\text{probit}(P(Y_{ij}=1)) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{ij} + \beta_2 \text{Effort}_{ij} + \beta_3 \text{Modality}_{ij} + \beta_4 P^{(\text{state})}_{ij} + \beta_5 (X_{ij} \times P^{(\text{state})}_{ij}) + \beta_6 P^{(\text{trait})}_{j} + \beta_7 \text{LC}_j + \beta_8 (X_{ij} \times P^{(\text{state})}_{ij} \times \text{LC}_j) + \beta_9 \text{Age}_j + \beta_{10} \text{Sex}_j + \beta_{11} \text{Education}_j + u_{0j} + u_{1j}X_{ij}$$

where $\text{LC}_j$ is the LC integrity metric (mean MTC~LC/pons~) for subject $j$, and the three-way interaction $X_{ij} \times P^{(\text{state})}_{ij} \times \text{LC}_j$ tests whether LC integrity moderates the coupling between pupil state and psychometric sensitivity. Age, sex, and education are included as covariates to control for potential confounds. The random effects structure remains consistent with the primary model. These analyses are exploratory given that (a) LC integrity data were not part of the original prospectus, (b) LC data are available for only a subset of participants, and (c) the primary focus remains on pupil–psychometric coupling rather than LC integrity per se.

### Analysis Plan: Confirmatory vs. Exploratory

The primary analyses specified in the prospectus are treated as **confirmatory**:
- Effort effects on psychometric function parameters (RQ1)
- Effort–pupil manipulation check (RQ2)
- Trial-level pupil–psychometric coupling (RQ3, primary analysis)
- Subject-level PF–pupil coupling (RQ4)

**Sensitivity analyses** (quality tier robustness checks, model comparison) are pre-specified and serve to evaluate the robustness of primary findings.

**Exploratory analyses** include:
- LC integrity moderation analyses (not in original prospectus)
- Any post-hoc analyses suggested by the data

# Results

The following sections present results from the complete analysis pipeline, including behavioral psychometric function parameters, effort–pupil manipulation checks, missingness diagnostics, primary pupil–psychometric coupling analyses, and subject-level individual differences. All analyses were conducted using the primary quality tier (baseline and cognitive window validity ≥ 0.60) unless otherwise specified.

## Behavioral Backbone (PF Outcomes)

if (!is.null(pf_params)) {
  pf_summary <- pf_params %>%

    summarise(
      n = n(),

```

Psychometric function parameters (thresholds and slopes) were estimated separately for each subject × task × effort combination using probit link functions with continuous stimulus intensity.

**Hypothesis Testing:** Hypothesis 1a predicted that thresholds would be higher (worse sensitivity) under High effort relative to Low effort, reflecting degraded signal-to-noise ratios from resource competition or supra-optimal arousal. Hypothesis 1b predicted that slopes would be shallower (lower sensitivity) under High effort, indicating increased variability in perceptual judgments when arousal is elevated. These hypotheses were tested by comparing PF parameters between High and Low effort conditions within each task modality.

## Effort–Pupil Manipulation Check

High-effort handgrip increased pupil dynamics relative to Low effort, confirming effective engagement of central arousal systems. Mixed-effects models tested whether effort condition predicted pupil metrics (Total AUC and Cognitive AUC) while controlling for task modality.

**Hypothesis Testing:** Hypothesis 2a predicted that baseline (tonic) pupil diameter would be larger under High effort, and Hypothesis 2b predicted that task-evoked pupil responses (AUC) would be larger under High effort. Both hypotheses were supported if High effort significantly increased Total AUC and Cognitive AUC relative to Low effort, providing a physiological manipulation check that physical effort modulates central arousal systems in older adults.

## Missingness Diagnostic

Missingness analyses tested whether pupil data retention was predicted by effort, stimulus intensity, modality, or response time using logistic mixed-effects models. This diagnostic is critical for assessing potential systematic bias in pupil data availability.

```{r missingness}
#| label: tbl-missingness
#| tbl-cap: "Missingness Diagnostic: Predictors of Pupil Data Usability"

if (!is.null(missingness_effects)) {
  missingness_effects %>%
    filter(term != "(Intercept)") %>%
    select(term, estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value) %>%
    mutate(
      term = str_replace_all(term, c(
        "effort_factorHigh" = "Effort (High vs Low)",
        "stimulus_intensity_scaled" = "Stimulus Intensity",
        "task_factorVDT" = "Task (VDT vs ADT)",
        "rt_scaled" = "Response Time"
      ))
    ) %>%
    make_table(
      col.names = c("Predictor", "Estimate (OR)", "SE", "z", "p"),
      digits = 3
    )
} else {
  cat("*Missingness diagnostic results not yet available.*")
}
```

```{r missingness-fig}
#| label: fig-missingness
#| fig-cap: "Missingness Diagnostic: RT by Pupil Data Availability"
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 6
#| out-width: "100%"

fig_path_abs <- fig_path("fig4_missingness_diagnostic.png", return_absolute = TRUE)
if (!is.null(fig_path_abs) && file.exists(fig_path_abs)) {
  knitr::include_graphics(fig_path("fig4_missingness_diagnostic.png"))
} else {
  cat("*Figure: fig4_missingness_diagnostic.png not yet generated.*")
}
```

[Results interpretation: If effort significantly predicts missingness, this indicates potential bias that should be acknowledged in interpretation. If missingness is random or predicted only by non-experimental variables, this supports the validity of the primary analyses.]

## Pupil–Psychometric Coupling (Primary Analysis)

```{r primary-coupling}
#| label: tbl-pupil-psychometric
#| tbl-cap: "Primary GLMM: Pupil–Psychometric Coupling"

if (!is.null(pupil_psychometric_effects)) {
  # Build base table
  tbl <- pupil_psychometric_effects %>%
    select(term, estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value) %>%
    make_table(
      col.names = c("Term", "Estimate", "SE", "z", "p"),
      digits = 4
    )
  
  # Return plain table (styling removed for DOCX/PDF compatibility)
  tbl
} else {
  cat("*Primary coupling analysis results not yet available.*")
}
```

The primary analysis tested whether trial-wise phasic arousal (pupil state) predicts psychometric sensitivity when stimulus intensity is modeled continuously. The key test is the interaction between stimulus intensity and pupil cognitive state, which directly assesses whether within-person fluctuations in arousal modulate psychometric sensitivity.

**Hypothesis Testing:** Hypothesis 3a predicted that the interaction between stimulus intensity and pupil state ($X_{ij} \times P^{(\text{state})}_{ij}$) would be negative, indicating that higher trial-level arousal is associated with shallower psychometric slopes (reduced sensitivity), consistent with supra-optimal arousal degrading signal quality. The alternative Hypothesis 3b allowed for a positive interaction if moderate arousal enhances sensitivity. Hypothesis 3c predicted minimal effects of pupil trait (between-subject baseline arousal) on sensitivity, as trait effects may be confounded with other individual differences.

**Interpretation of Results:** If the interaction term is non-significant, this suggests that within-person fluctuations in arousal (pupil state) do not reliably modulate psychometric sensitivity beyond the effects of effort condition. This could indicate that (a) effort main effects (captured by the effort factor in the model) are the primary drivers of sensitivity changes, potentially reflecting resource competition rather than moment-to-moment arousal fluctuations, (b) the relationship between arousal and sensitivity is weaker than expected in older adults, or (c) the fixed-window cognitive pupil metric may not capture the most relevant arousal dynamics for psychometric sensitivity. However, a non-significant interaction does not negate the possibility that effort-induced arousal changes affect performance at the group level (via effort main effects); it suggests that trial-wise arousal fluctuations may not be the primary mechanism. The robustness checks across quality tiers and model comparison help evaluate whether this pattern is consistent and whether the interaction term meaningfully improves model fit.

### Robustness Checks and Sensitivity Analyses

To assess the robustness of our primary findings, we conducted several sensitivity analyses:

**1. Quality Tier Robustness Checks**

Results were tested across multiple quality tiers (lenient ≥0.50, primary ≥0.60, strict ≥0.70) to ensure robustness to different data inclusion criteria. If the key interaction effect is consistent across all three quality tiers, this provides evidence that the finding is robust to different data quality thresholds.

```{r robustness-checks}

  interaction_lenient <- pupil_psychometric_lenient %>%
    filter(term == "stimulus_intensity_scaled:pupil_cognitive_state_scaled")
  
  interaction_strict <- pupil_psychometric_strict %>%
    filter(term == "stimulus_intensity_scaled:pupil_cognitive_state_scaled")
  
  # Extract interaction terms safely
  get_interaction <- function(df) {

        ))
      }

    return(list(estimate = NA, se = NA, z = NA, p = NA))
  }

      digits = 4
    )
} else {
  cat("*Robustness check results not yet available.*")
}
```

**2. Model Comparison**

To evaluate whether the interaction term meaningfully improves model fit, we compared the primary model (with stimulus intensity × pupil state interaction) to an alternative model without the interaction term. Models were compared using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), where lower AIC values indicate better fit.

**3. Missingness Diagnostic**

As reported in the Missingness Diagnostic section above, we tested whether missing pupil data were systematically related to experimental conditions (effort, stimulus intensity, task, response time). If missingness is random or only related to non-experimental variables (e.g., individual differences in eye-tracking quality), this supports the validity of the primary analyses. If missingness is systematically related to experimental conditions, this could introduce bias and should be acknowledged in interpretation, with robustness checks helping to evaluate whether findings are sensitive to missingness patterns.

Subject-level changes in pupil metrics (High–Low effort) were correlated with subject-level changes in PF parameters (High–Low effort). This analysis tests whether individuals who show stronger physiological responses to effort also show larger behavioral sensitivity changes.

**Hypothesis Testing:** Hypothesis 4 predicted that subject-level changes in pupil metrics (Δpupil = High effort − Low effort) would be positively correlated with changes in thresholds (Δthreshold) and negatively correlated with changes in slopes (Δslope), indicating that individuals with stronger effort-evoked arousal responses also show larger behavioral sensitivity decrements. This hypothesis was tested using Pearson correlations between Δpupil and ΔPF parameters, separately for each task modality.

# Discussion

## Integration with Theoretical Frameworks

The present findings contribute to understanding how physical effort and arousal relate to perceptual sensitivity in older adults. The results are interpreted in light of several theoretical frameworks introduced earlier: the Yerkes–Dodson law (inverted-U relationship between arousal and performance), Adaptive Gain Theory (optimal LC–NE balance for performance), and resource competition models (limited capacity for dual-task performance).

### Arousal–Performance Relationships

If the primary interaction (stimulus intensity × pupil state) is significant and negative, this would support the hypothesis that higher trial-level arousal is associated with reduced psychometric sensitivity, consistent with supra-optimal arousal degrading signal quality in older adults. This pattern would align with the Yerkes–Dodson framework's prediction that older adults may be more easily pushed onto the descending limb of the arousal–performance curve [@mather2016; @huang2024]. Alternatively, if the interaction is non-significant, this suggests that moment-to-moment arousal fluctuations may not be the primary mechanism linking effort to sensitivity changes. In this case, effort main effects (which may reflect both resource competition and group-level arousal changes) may be the dominant drivers of performance differences.

### Resource Competition vs. Arousal Mechanisms

The chapter's focus on pupil-indexed arousal does not preclude resource competition as a contributing mechanism. Effort main effects in the GLMM capture overall High vs. Low effort differences, which may reflect both generic dual-task interference and arousal-mediated changes. If trial-wise pupil state does not significantly predict sensitivity beyond effort condition, this would suggest that resource competition or effort-induced group-level arousal changes (rather than moment-to-moment fluctuations) are the primary drivers. The psychometric function framework allows us to distinguish sensitivity changes (signal quality) from criterion shifts (response strategy), providing insight into whether effort effects reflect altered evidence quality (consistent with arousal effects on neural gain) versus strategic adjustments (consistent with resource allocation).

### State vs. Trait Arousal Effects

The decomposition of pupil metrics into state (within-person) and trait (between-person) components allows us to test distinct hypotheses about how arousal relates to sensitivity. If pupil state significantly predicts sensitivity (via the interaction), this supports the hypothesis that moment-to-moment arousal fluctuations modulate perceptual processing. If pupil trait shows minimal effects (as predicted by Hypothesis 3c), this suggests that stable individual differences in average arousal may be confounded with other factors (e.g., LC integrity, cognitive reserve, general health) that are better captured by direct measures of those constructs.

## Implications for Aging and Arousal

The findings have implications for understanding how aging modulates the relationship between physiological arousal and cognitive performance. If older adults show weaker or absent coupling between trial-wise arousal and sensitivity (compared to younger adults in Chapter 1), this could indicate age-related changes in how the LC–NE system modulates cortical gain. Alternatively, if effort main effects are robust but trial-wise coupling is weak, this suggests that older adults may be more sensitive to effort-induced arousal at the group level but less sensitive to moment-to-moment fluctuations, potentially reflecting reduced phasic LC responsiveness or altered gain modulation.

## Limitations

Several limitations should be considered when interpreting the findings:

### Pupil Data Quality Constraints

Pupil data quality varies across older adults due to factors such as eye-tracking challenges, increased blink rates, and age-related changes in pupil dynamics. The quality tier system (primary ≥0.60, lenient ≥0.50, strict ≥0.70) addresses this by testing robustness across different inclusion criteria. However, even with quality filtering, some participants may have limited usable pupil data, potentially reducing power for detecting state-level effects.

### Missingness Patterns

The missingness diagnostic tests whether pupil data loss is systematic (e.g., related to effort, stimulus intensity, or task). If missingness is predicted by experimental conditions, this could introduce bias. The robustness checks across quality tiers help evaluate whether findings are sensitive to missingness patterns, but systematic missingness remains a potential limitation.

### Sample Size Considerations

The effective sample size for detecting trial-level interactions depends on both the number of participants and the number of usable trials per participant. If many participants have sparse pupil data, power to detect state-level effects may be limited. The model comparison (AIC) and robustness checks help evaluate whether null findings reflect true absence of effects versus insufficient power.

### LC Integrity Subset Limitations

LC integrity data are available for only a subset of participants. If participants with LC data differ systematically from those without (e.g., in age, cognitive function, or behavioral performance), this limits the generalizability of LC integrity findings. The LC subset bias check addresses this, but the exploratory LC analyses should be interpreted with caution given the subset limitation.

### Fixed-Window vs. Response-Locked Metrics

The primary cognitive pupil metric uses a fixed-duration post-target window to reduce RT confounding. However, this may not capture the most relevant arousal dynamics for psychometric sensitivity. Response-locked metrics (evaluated in sensitivity analyses) may better capture decision-related arousal but are more susceptible to RT confounding. The choice of window definition represents a trade-off between physiological validity and measurement confounds.

## Integration with Chapter 1 and Chapter 3

Chapter 2 extends the dual-task paradigm from younger adults (Chapter 1) to older adults, testing whether arousal–sensitivity coupling is preserved or altered with age. If Chapter 1 shows robust coupling in younger adults but Chapter 2 shows weaker or absent coupling in older adults, this would suggest age-related changes in how arousal modulates perceptual sensitivity. Alternatively, if both chapters show similar patterns, this would suggest that the arousal–sensitivity relationship is relatively stable across the adult lifespan, with age effects manifesting primarily in baseline sensitivity or effort reactivity rather than in the coupling mechanism itself.

Chapter 3 will use hierarchical drift diffusion modeling to decompose the behavioral patterns observed in Chapter 2 into latent decision parameters (drift rate, boundary separation, starting point, non-decision time). This will test whether arousal effects are more consistent with altered evidence quality (drift rate changes) versus strategic response adjustments (boundary separation changes), providing a mechanistic account of how physical effort and arousal reshape perceptual decisions in aging.

## Conclusions and Future Directions

Chapter 2 provides a statistically rigorous characterization of how pupil-indexed arousal covaries with psychophysical decision behavior in older adults, using continuous stimulus intensity modeling and within-subject centering to preserve individual arousal granularity. The findings contribute to understanding whether physical effort–induced arousal modulates perceptual sensitivity at the trial level, and whether this relationship is robust across data quality thresholds and model specifications.

Future research directions include: (a) examining whether different pupil window definitions (e.g., response-locked, different durations) reveal stronger coupling, (b) testing whether LC integrity moderates arousal–sensitivity relationships, (c) comparing arousal–sensitivity coupling between younger and older adults directly, and (d) using computational modeling (Chapter 3) to identify the latent decision parameters that implement the observed behavioral patterns.

The work presented here establishes the empirical and methodological foundation for Chapter 3, which will examine whether latent decision parameters provide a coherent mechanistic account of how physical effort and arousal reshape perceptual decisions in aging.
