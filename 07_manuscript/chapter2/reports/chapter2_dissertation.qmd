# Introduction

## Physical–Cognitive Dual-Task Interactions in Everyday Life and Aging

Everyday life frequently requires people to perform cognitively demanding tasks while simultaneously exerting physical effort. Surgeons must maintain continuous muscle engagement while making fine perceptual discriminations, athletes coordinate complex motor sequences while monitoring environmental cues, and older adults navigate dual-task situations—such as walking while monitoring traffic or carrying groceries while having a conversation—in which physical and cognitive demands interact dynamically. These real-world scenarios highlight a fundamental challenge: when multiple task domains compete for limited cognitive resources, performance in one or both domains may suffer [@wickens2008; @pashler1994dual]. This challenge takes on particular significance in aging, as older adults face both declining cognitive capacity and increased physiological costs of effortful engagement [@salthouse1996; @verhaeghen2003].

A growing literature suggests that physical–cognitive interactions are mediated by shared arousal systems, particularly the locus coeruleus–noradrenergic (LC–NE) system, which modulates sensory gain, evidence accumulation, and response caution as a function of task demands and internal state [@astonjones2005; @mather2016; @jepma2012neural]. Understanding how physical effort modulates cognitive performance—and how this relationship changes with age—requires moving beyond simple outcome measures (overall accuracy or mean reaction time) to characterize how effort-induced arousal alters the fundamental processes underlying perceptual decision-making. The present study addresses this question by combining a physical–cognitive dual-task paradigm with pupillometry and psychometric function analysis to examine how physical effort–induced arousal relates to perceptual sensitivity in older adults.

## Psychometric Functions: Quantifying Perceptual Sensitivity

### Theoretical Framework

Psychometric functions (PFs) provide a principled framework for characterizing how stimulus intensity relates to perceptual performance. Unlike summary statistics that collapse across stimulus levels, PFs model the complete intensity–response relationship, revealing how performance changes as stimulus differences become more or less discriminable. In a same–different discrimination task, the psychometric function maps continuous stimulus intensity (e.g., frequency offset or contrast difference) onto the probability of correctly detecting a difference or choosing "different" [@wichmann2001psychometric; @green1966signal].

### Mathematical Formulation

The psychometric function typically follows a sigmoidal (S-shaped) curve, most commonly modeled using the cumulative normal distribution (probit link) or logistic function (logit link). For binary choice tasks, the probit formulation is:

$$P(\text{"different"} | X) = \Phi\left(\frac{X - \alpha}{\beta}\right)$$ {#eq-psychometric}

where:
- $P(\text{"different"} | X)$ is the probability of choosing "different" given stimulus intensity $X$
- $\Phi(\cdot)$ is the cumulative standard normal distribution function (probit link)
- $\alpha$ is the **threshold** (point of subjective equality, PSE, or just noticeable difference, JND), representing the stimulus intensity at which performance reaches 50% (or other criterion level)
- $\beta$ is the **slope** parameter, representing the steepness of the function and inversely related to perceptual sensitivity: steeper slopes indicate higher sensitivity (smaller intensity differences are reliably detected)

Alternatively, using the logit link:

$$P(\text{"different"} | X) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp\left(-\frac{X - \alpha}{\beta}\right)}$$ {#eq-psychometric-logit}

### Key Parameters

**Threshold ($\alpha$ or PSE/JND):** The threshold parameter indicates the stimulus intensity at which participants perform at a criterion level (typically 50% "different" responses). A lower threshold indicates better sensitivity—participants can detect smaller stimulus differences. In aging research, threshold increases often reflect reduced perceptual sensitivity, requiring larger stimulus differences for reliable detection.

**Slope ($\beta$):** The slope parameter quantifies how rapidly performance improves as stimulus intensity increases. Steeper slopes indicate higher sensitivity and lower variability in perceptual judgments. Slope is inversely related to the standard deviation of the underlying sensory noise distribution: $\sigma = 1/\beta$ (for probit) or $\sigma = \beta \cdot \pi / \sqrt{3}$ (for logit). Age-related slope reductions suggest increased sensory noise or decreased discriminability [@green1966signal; @wichmann2001psychometric].

**Relationship to Signal Detection Theory:** The psychometric function is closely related to signal detection theory (SDT), where threshold corresponds to the decision criterion and slope relates to $d'$ (sensitivity). Changes in threshold reflect criterion shifts (response bias), while changes in slope reflect true sensitivity changes [@macmillan2005detection].

### Advantages Over Summary Statistics

Modeling continuous intensity–response relationships via PFs offers several advantages over collapsing trials into discrete "Easy/Hard" bins:

1. **Preserves information:** Continuous intensity is maintained rather than lost through binning, allowing more precise estimates of sensitivity changes.
2. **Parameter interpretability:** Threshold and slope have clear psychological and mathematical meanings, facilitating mechanistic interpretation.
3. **Statistical power:** Using all stimulus levels simultaneously provides more efficient parameter estimation than comparing discrete bins.
4. **Quantifies sensitivity changes:** Slope changes directly reflect how arousal alters the intensity–performance relationship, distinguishing true sensitivity effects from criterion shifts.

## Arousal, Effort, and Perceptual Performance

### Theoretical Perspectives on Arousal–Performance Relationships

The relationship between arousal and cognitive performance has been formalized in several influential frameworks. The **Yerkes–Dodson law** [@yerkes1908] posits an inverted-U function: performance improves with increasing arousal up to an optimal point, beyond which further arousal (especially stress or anxiety) impairs performance. **Adaptive Gain Theory (AGT)** [@astonjones2005] provides a neural mechanism linking phasic and tonic LC–NE activity to optimal task performance, with moderate tonic baseline and robust phasic bursts facilitating focused attention and rapid behavioral responses.

In the context of aging, this relationship becomes more complex. Research suggests that the arousal–performance curve may be altered in older adults, often manifesting as a **leftward shift or compression** of the inverted-U function [@mather2016; @mikneviciute2022]. This implies that older adults may reach their optimal arousal peak at lower levels of objective demand than younger adults. Consequently, levels of effort or stress that might be engaging or beneficial for younger adults (placing them at the peak of the curve) can push older adults onto the "descending limb," leading to **supra-optimal arousal** and performance decrements [@huang2024; @mather2016].

### Physical Effort as an Arousal Manipulation

Physical effort provides a powerful, controlled method for manipulating arousal state. Sustained isometric handgrip at moderate-to-high intensities (e.g., 30–40% of maximum voluntary contraction, MVC) elicits a robust pressor and sympathoexcitatory response—raising arterial pressure and heart rate and increasing sympathetic outflow—whose magnitude scales with contraction intensity and is preserved in older adults. At the neural level, static handgrip and postexercise ischemia recruit brainstem and cortical regions implicated in autonomic control and effort, providing a plausible central substrate for effort-induced shifts in arousal that can interact with perceptual decision processes [@mark1985; @toska2010; @lalande2014; @sander2010].

The **limited-capacity framework** [@wickens2008] predicts that concurrent physical effort should compete with cognitive tasks for shared processing resources, potentially degrading performance when demands exceed available capacity. Supporting this view, Azer et al. [-@azer2023] found that older adults showed significantly reduced accuracy in a visual working memory task while maintaining moderate handgrip (30% MVC), whereas younger adults remained unaffected. This suggests that the combined demand of physical and cognitive tasks may more easily deplete resources in older adults or drive arousal into a dysregulated state [@verhaeghen2003].

### Expected Effects on Psychometric Sensitivity

How should physical effort–induced arousal affect psychometric function parameters? Theoretical predictions vary:

**Threshold ($\alpha$) predictions:**
- If arousal degrades sensory signal quality or increases internal noise, thresholds should increase (larger stimulus differences required for reliable detection).
- If arousal optimizes neural gain at moderate levels, thresholds might decrease (better sensitivity).
- Supra-optimal arousal in older adults might shift thresholds upward, reflecting degraded signal-to-noise ratios.

**Slope ($\beta$) predictions:**
- Steeper slopes (higher sensitivity) would suggest that arousal enhances discriminability, perhaps by improving signal-to-noise ratios or sharpening neural tuning.
- Shallower slopes (lower sensitivity) would suggest that arousal introduces variability or noise, flattening the intensity–response relationship.
- The relationship may be non-linear: moderate arousal might enhance sensitivity (steeper slopes), while excessive arousal might flatten slopes (reduced discriminability).

## Pupillometry: A Window into Arousal Dynamics

### Locus Coeruleus–Norepinephrine System and Pupil Diameter

The LC–NE system serves as a central regulator of cortical arousal and cognitive state. This small brainstem nucleus is the primary source of norepinephrine to the forebrain and modulates the "neural gain" of cortical circuits—essentially the signal-to-noise ratio of information processing [@astonjones2005]. According to Adaptive Gain Theory, optimal performance relies on a balance between moderate tonic (baseline) LC firing that promotes focused attention and robust phasic (event-related) bursts that facilitate rapid behavioral responses to task-relevant stimuli [@gilzenrat2010].

**Pupillometry** provides a powerful, non-invasive window into these LC–NE dynamics. Pupil diameter tracks LC firing activity with high temporal precision [@joshi2016; @murphy2014], making it an ideal proxy for both tonic and phasic arousal states. The neural pathway linking LC to pupil diameter involves direct projections from LC to the Edinger–Westphal nucleus, which controls pupil constriction/dilation via parasympathetic and sympathetic pathways [@mcDougal2010].

### Pupil Metrics in Cognitive Tasks

Two primary pupil metrics capture distinct aspects of arousal:

**Baseline/Tonic Pupil Diameter:** Reflects tonic LC activity and general alertness levels [@gilzenrat2010; @alnaes2014pupil]. Larger baseline pupil diameter indicates higher tonic arousal, which may support sustained attention but can also reflect hyperarousal if excessive.

**Task-Evoked Pupil Response (TEPR):** Reflects phasic LC activation and the mobilization of mental effort during task execution [@beatty1982; @kahneman1966]. The TEPR typically peaks 1–2 seconds after stimulus onset and is quantified as:
- **Peak amplitude:** Maximum dilation relative to baseline
- **Area Under the Curve (AUC):** Integral of the baseline-corrected pupil signal over a time window, capturing both amplitude and duration of the response
- **Mean dilation:** Average pupil diameter over a fixed post-stimulus window

TEPR magnitude has been linked to task difficulty, cognitive load, surprise, and decision confidence [@preuschoff2011pupil; @vanbergen2021]. In discrimination tasks, larger TEPRs are associated with more difficult decisions, suggesting that phasic arousal signals the recruitment of cognitive control resources [@kiefer2018].

### Pupil–Cognition Links in Aging

In aging, the LC–NE system undergoes significant changes. Structural degradation of the LC is common in older adults [@mather2016], and functional compensatory mechanisms often emerge, such as chronically elevated tonic arousal or hyper-responsivity to challenge [@lee2018; @mather2016neural]. However, this compensation has limits: if older adults reach supra-optimal arousal states more readily, excessive norepinephrine release may lead to distractibility, indiscriminate processing, and performance decrements [@astonjones2005; @eldar2013].

Pupillometry studies in aging reveal complex patterns. Older adults often show larger baseline pupil diameters but reduced task-evoked responses, suggesting altered phasic–tonic balance [@granholm2007; @vanbergen2021]. Physical effort manipulations provide an opportunity to examine how externally induced arousal modulates these dynamics and whether effort-induced pupil changes predict cognitive performance changes.

## Dual-Task Paradigms and Resource Competition

### Theoretical Frameworks

Dual-task paradigms, in which participants perform two tasks simultaneously, have been central to understanding resource limitations and cognitive architecture. Several theoretical frameworks explain dual-task interference:

**Limited Capacity Model** [@kahneman1973; @wickens2008]: Posits that cognitive resources are finite and shared across tasks. When total demand exceeds capacity, performance suffers in one or both tasks.

**Resource Competition** [@navon1984; @navon1985]: Emphasizes that interference occurs when tasks compete for the same resource pool (e.g., both require attention or working memory).

**Multiple Resource Theory** [@wickens2008]: Proposes that interference depends on the similarity of resource requirements. Tasks using different resource dimensions (e.g., spatial vs. verbal) show less interference than tasks using similar dimensions.

### Physical–Cognitive Dual Tasks

Physical–cognitive dual tasks are particularly relevant for understanding real-world performance. When physical effort (e.g., maintaining handgrip force) is combined with cognitive tasks (e.g., perceptual discrimination), interference can arise from multiple sources:

1. **Shared attentional resources:** Both tasks require sustained attention and monitoring [@proctor2012].
2. **Physiological arousal:** Physical effort increases sympathetic activation, which may enhance or impair cognitive performance depending on arousal level [@silvestrini2008].
3. **Motor–cognitive interference:** Maintaining grip force may compete with response selection and execution processes [@woollacott2002].

Age-related changes in dual-task performance are well-documented, with older adults showing larger performance decrements under dual-task conditions [@verhaeghen2003; @beurskens2014]. This may reflect reduced cognitive reserve, impaired executive control, or altered arousal regulation.

## Linking Arousal to Psychometric Sensitivity: A Novel Approach

### Beyond Binned Analyses

Traditional approaches to examining arousal–performance relationships often collapse trials into discrete difficulty bins (e.g., "Easy" vs. "Hard"), losing information about continuous stimulus intensity. This binning approach assumes that arousal effects are uniform across intensity levels and cannot reveal how arousal modulates the intensity–response relationship itself.

### Within-Subject Centering: Separating State from Trait

A crucial methodological step in linking pupil metrics to performance is distinguishing **state** arousal (momentary fluctuations) from **trait** arousal (stable individual differences). To achieve this, we decompose each pupil metric $P_{ij}$—measured on trial $i$ for subject $j$—into within-subject (state) and between-subject (trait) components using within-subject centering:

$$P^{(\text{trait})}_{j} = \overline{P}_{j}, \qquad P^{(\text{state})}_{ij} = P_{ij} - \overline{P}_{j}$$ {#eq-state-trait}

where $\overline{P}_{j}$ is the subject's mean pupil metric across trials. Here, $P^{(\text{trait})}_{j}$ captures stable, subject-level differences in arousal (e.g., consistently larger baseline pupils or generally larger TEPRs), whereas $P^{(\text{state})}_{ij}$ captures trial-level deviations from that individual's mean (i.e., whether arousal on a given trial is higher or lower than usual for that person).

Including both components as predictors in the same model allows us to ask two distinct questions: (1) Do individuals with higher average arousal levels (trait) tend to show different psychometric sensitivity than those with lower average arousal? and (2) Within a given individual, do trials on which arousal is higher than their personal average show better or worse sensitivity? This decomposition avoids conflating between-person and within-person effects, a common problem in mixed data structures [@enders2013; @hoffman2015]. For example, if high-arousal individuals tend to have poorer performance for reasons unrelated to trial-wise fluctuations (e.g., underlying LC degeneration or comorbidities), that pattern will be captured at the trait level rather than falsely attributed to trial-wise changes in arousal.

### Hierarchical GLMM Framework

To formally test how arousal relates to psychometric sensitivity, the present study employs hierarchical generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) with a probit link. These models capture the binary decision outcome on each trial (e.g., "different" vs. "same" or correct vs. incorrect) as a function of continuous stimulus intensity, effort condition, modality, and pupil-indexed arousal, while also accounting for individual differences through random effects. The primary model can be written as:

$$\text{probit}(P(Y_{ij}=1)) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{ij} + \beta_2 \text{Effort}_{ij} + \beta_3 \text{Modality}_{ij} + \beta_4 P^{(\text{state})}_{ij} + \beta_5 (X_{ij} \times P^{(\text{state})}_{ij}) + \beta_6 P^{(\text{trait})}_{j} + u_{0j} + u_{1j}X_{ij}$$ {#eq-primary-glmm}

where $Y_{ij}$ is the binary outcome on trial $i$ for subject $j$ (e.g., a correct "different" response), and $X_{ij}$ is the continuous stimulus intensity on that trial. $\text{Effort}_{ij}$ codes the handgrip effort condition (High vs. Low), and $\text{Modality}_{ij}$ codes the sensory modality (auditory vs. visual). $P^{(\text{state})}_{ij}$ and $P^{(\text{trait})}_{j}$ are the state and trait components of the pupil metric, respectively, as defined above. The terms $u_{0j}$ and $u_{1j}$ are subject-specific random intercepts and random slopes on $X_{ij}$, allowing each participant to have their own baseline performance level and intensity sensitivity.

The **key interaction term** in this model is $X_{ij} \times P^{(\text{state})}_{ij}$, whose coefficient $\beta_5$ tests whether within-person fluctuations in arousal modulate psychometric sensitivity. A significant interaction would indicate that the slope of the intensity–response function depends on trial-level arousal: for example, high-arousal trials might show flatter or steeper psychometric curves than low-arousal trials, even after accounting for between-person differences in average arousal (via $P^{(\text{trait})}_{j}$). This hierarchical GLMM framework thus allows us to preserve the continuous nature of the stimulus dimension, rigorously separate state and trait arousal effects, and model individual differences in baseline sensitivity, while directly testing our central hypotheses about pupil–psychometric coupling in older adults.

## Research Questions and Hypotheses

Based on the theoretical frameworks and methodological considerations outlined above, the present study addresses the following research questions:

### Research Question 1: Behavioral Backbone

**RQ1:** How do High (40% MVC) versus Low (5% MVC) handgrip effort conditions alter psychometric function parameters (thresholds and slopes) in older adults performing auditory and visual same–different discrimination?

**Hypothesis 1a:** Thresholds will be higher (worse sensitivity) under High effort relative to Low effort, reflecting degraded signal-to-noise ratios from resource competition or supra-optimal arousal.

**Hypothesis 1b:** Slopes will be shallower (lower sensitivity) under High effort, indicating increased variability in perceptual judgments when arousal is elevated.

### Research Question 2: Effort–Pupil Manipulation Check

**RQ2:** Does High effort increase tonic and task-evoked pupil dynamics relative to Low effort in older adults?

**Hypothesis 2a:** Baseline (tonic) pupil diameter will be larger under High effort, indicating elevated tonic arousal.

**Hypothesis 2b:** Task-evoked pupil responses (TEPR, quantified as AUC) will be larger under High effort, indicating increased phasic arousal during task execution.

### Research Question 3: Pupil–Psychometric Coupling (Primary)

**RQ3:** Does trial-wise phasic arousal (pupil state) predict psychometric sensitivity when stimulus intensity is modeled continuously?

**Hypothesis 3a:** The interaction between stimulus intensity and pupil state ($X_{ij} \times P^{(\text{state})}_{ij}$) will be negative, indicating that higher trial-level arousal is associated with shallower psychometric slopes (reduced sensitivity). This would be consistent with supra-optimal arousal degrading signal quality or introducing noise.

**Hypothesis 3b (Alternative):** If moderate arousal enhances performance, the interaction might be positive, indicating steeper slopes (higher sensitivity) when arousal is elevated.

**Hypothesis 3c:** Pupil trait (between-subject baseline arousal) will show weaker or null associations with sensitivity, as trait effects may be confounded with other individual differences (e.g., LC integrity, cognitive reserve).

### Research Question 4: Subject-Level Individual Differences

**RQ4:** Do individuals with larger effort-evoked arousal changes (High–Low effort) also show larger effort-related changes in PF parameters?

**Hypothesis 4:** Subject-level changes in pupil metrics (Δpupil = High effort − Low effort) will be positively correlated with subject-level changes in thresholds (Δthreshold) and negatively correlated with changes in slopes (Δslope), indicating that individuals who show stronger physiological responses to effort also show larger behavioral sensitivity decrements.

Each trial followed this sequence:
1. Pre-squeeze baseline: 3 seconds
2. Sustained squeeze period: 3 seconds (Low or High effort)
3. Standard stimulus: 0.1 seconds
4. Inter-stimulus interval (ISI): 0.5 seconds
5. Target stimulus: 0.1 seconds
6. Response window: Participants indicated whether the target was "same" or "different" from the standard

## Pupillometry

Pupil diameter was recorded continuously throughout each trial using an eye-tracking system. The data were processed using a MATLAB preprocessing pipeline that segments trials relative to squeeze onset, flags blinks and track loss events, computes window-specific validity metrics, and implements baseline correction using pre-event windows.

### Pupil Features

Two primary features were computed on each trial:

1. **Total AUC:** Baseline-corrected area under the pupil curve over a global trial window, indexing overall arousal during concurrent physical effort.

2. **Cognitive pupil metric (primary):** Baseline-corrected task-evoked measure computed in a fixed-duration post-target window (e.g., from 300 ms after target onset through a fixed 1 s window), designed to reduce confounding by response time and late-trial dropout.

### Quality Tiers

Pupil-based analyses used pre-specified quality tiers:

- **Primary tier:** Window validity ≥ 0.60 for baseline and cognitive windows
- **Lenient tier:** Window validity ≥ 0.50 (robustness check)
- **Strict tier:** Window validity ≥ 0.70 (robustness check)

## Statistical Analysis

### Psychometric Function Fitting

Psychometric functions were fitted using probit link functions with continuous stimulus intensity as the predictor. Parameters (thresholds and slopes) were estimated separately for each subject × task × effort combination.

### Primary GLMM

The primary model used a probit link function to link phasic arousal to psychometric sensitivity:

$$\text{probit}(P(Y_{ij}=1)) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{ij} + \beta_2 \text{Effort}_{ij} + \beta_3 \text{Modality}_{ij} + \beta_4 P^{(\text{state})}_{ij} + \beta_5 (X_{ij} \times P^{(\text{state})}_{ij}) + \beta_6 P^{(\text{trait})}_{j} + u_{0j} + u_{1j}X_{ij}$$

where $Y_{ij}$ is the binary choice on trial $i$ for subject $j$, $X_{ij}$ is continuous stimulus intensity, $P^{(\text{state})}_{ij}$ is the within-subject centered pupil metric (trial value - subject mean), and $P^{(\text{trait})}_{j}$ is the between-subject pupil metric (subject mean). The key interaction term $X_{ij} \times P^{(\text{state})}_{ij}$ tests whether within-person fluctuations in arousal are associated with changes in psychometric sensitivity.

# Results

The following sections present results from the complete analysis pipeline, including behavioral psychometric function parameters, effort–pupil manipulation checks, missingness diagnostics, primary pupil–psychometric coupling analyses, and subject-level individual differences. All analyses were conducted using the primary quality tier (baseline and cognitive window validity ≥ 0.60) unless otherwise specified.

## Behavioral Backbone (PF Outcomes)

```{r pf-backbone}
#| label: tbl-pf-params
#| tbl-cap: "Psychometric Function Parameters by Task and Effort"

if (!is.null(pf_params)) {

Psychometric function parameters (thresholds and slopes) were estimated separately for each subject × task × effort combination using probit link functions with continuous stimulus intensity.

fig_path_abs <- fig_path("fig1_psychometric_by_effort.png", return_absolute = TRUE)
if (!is.null(fig_path_abs) && file.exists(fig_path_abs)) {

## Effort–Pupil Manipulation Check

```{r effort-pupil-check}
#| label: tbl-effort-pupil
#| tbl-cap: "Effort Effect on Pupil Metrics"

if (!is.null(effort_pupil_effects) || !is.null(effort_total_auc_effects)) {
  # Combine both Total AUC and Cognitive AUC results
  effort_results_list <- list()
  
  if (!is.null(effort_total_auc_effects)) {
    effort_results_list$total <- effort_total_auc_effects %>%
      filter(term == "effort_factorHigh") %>%
      mutate(metric = "Total AUC") %>%
      select(metric, estimate, std.error, statistic)
  }
  
  if (!is.null(effort_pupil_effects)) {
    effort_results_list$cog <- effort_pupil_effects %>%
      filter(term == "effort_factorHigh") %>%
      mutate(metric = "Cognitive AUC") %>%
      select(metric, estimate, std.error, statistic)
  }

        caption = "Effort Effect on Pupil Metrics (High vs Low Effort)"
      )
  } else {
    cat("*Effort–pupil manipulation check results not yet available.*")
  }
} else {
  cat("*Effort–pupil manipulation check results not yet available.*")
}
```

High-effort handgrip increased pupil dynamics relative to Low effort, confirming effective engagement of central arousal systems. Mixed-effects models tested whether effort condition predicted pupil metrics (Total AUC and Cognitive AUC) while controlling for task modality.

if (!is.null(fig_path_abs) && file.exists(fig_path_abs)) {
  knitr::include_graphics(fig_path("fig2_effort_pupil_manipulation.png"))
} else {
  fig_path_abs2 <- fig_path("effort_manipulation_cog_auc.png", return_absolute = TRUE)

  } else {
    cat("*Figure: fig2_effort_pupil_manipulation.png not yet generated.*")
  }
}
```

## Missingness Diagnostic

Missingness analyses tested whether pupil data retention was predicted by effort, stimulus intensity, modality, or response time using logistic mixed-effects models. This diagnostic is critical for assessing potential systematic bias in pupil data availability.

```{r missingness}
#| label: tbl-missingness
#| tbl-cap: "Missingness Diagnostic: Predictors of Pupil Data Usability"

if (!is.null(missingness_effects)) {
  missingness_effects %>%
    filter(term != "(Intercept)") %>%
    select(term, estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value) %>%
    mutate(
      term = str_replace_all(term, c(
        "effort_factorHigh" = "Effort (High vs Low)",
        "stimulus_intensity_scaled" = "Stimulus Intensity",
        "task_factorVDT" = "Task (VDT vs ADT)",
        "rt_scaled" = "Response Time"
      ))
    ) %>%
    make_table(
      col.names = c("Predictor", "Estimate (OR)", "SE", "z", "p"),
      digits = 3
    )
} else {
  cat("*Missingness diagnostic results not yet available.*")
}
```

```{r missingness-fig}
#| label: fig-missingness
#| fig-cap: "Missingness Diagnostic: RT by Pupil Data Availability"
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 6
#| out-width: "100%"

fig_path_abs <- fig_path("fig4_missingness_diagnostic.png", return_absolute = TRUE)
if (!is.null(fig_path_abs) && file.exists(fig_path_abs)) {
  knitr::include_graphics(fig_path("fig4_missingness_diagnostic.png"))
} else {
  cat("*Figure: fig4_missingness_diagnostic.png not yet generated.*")
}
```

[Results interpretation: If effort significantly predicts missingness, this indicates potential bias that should be acknowledged in interpretation. If missingness is random or predicted only by non-experimental variables, this supports the validity of the primary analyses.]

## Pupil–Psychometric Coupling (Primary Analysis)

```{r primary-coupling}
#| label: tbl-pupil-psychometric
#| tbl-cap: "Primary GLMM: Pupil–Psychometric Coupling"

if (!is.null(pupil_psychometric_effects)) {
  # Build base table
  tbl <- pupil_psychometric_effects %>%
    select(term, estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value) %>%
    make_table(
      col.names = c("Term", "Estimate", "SE", "z", "p"),
      digits = 4
    )
  
  # Return plain table (styling removed for DOCX/PDF compatibility)
  tbl
} else {
  cat("*Primary coupling analysis results not yet available.*")
}
```

The primary analysis tested whether trial-wise phasic arousal (pupil state) predicts psychometric sensitivity when stimulus intensity is modeled continuously. The key test is the interaction between stimulus intensity and pupil cognitive state, which directly assesses whether within-person fluctuations in arousal modulate psychometric sensitivity.

### Robustness Checks

Results were tested across multiple quality tiers (lenient ≥0.50, primary ≥0.60, strict ≥0.70) to ensure robustness to different data inclusion criteria.

```{r robustness-checks}
#| label: tbl-robustness
#| tbl-cap: "Robustness Checks: Interaction Effect Across Quality Tiers"

        ))
      }
    }
    return(list(estimate = NA, se = NA, z = NA, p = NA))
  }
  
  lenient_int <- get_interaction(pupil_psychometric_lenient)
  primary_int <- get_interaction(pupil_psychometric_effects)
  strict_int <- get_interaction(pupil_psychometric_strict)
  
  robustness_table <- tibble(
    Quality_Tier = c("Lenient (≥0.50)", "Primary (≥0.60)", "Strict (≥0.70)"),
    Estimate = c(lenient_int$estimate, primary_int$estimate, strict_int$estimate),
    SE = c(lenient_int$se, primary_int$se, strict_int$se),

## Subject-Level PF–Pupil Coupling

Subject-level changes in pupil metrics (High–Low effort) were correlated with subject-level changes in PF parameters (High–Low effort). This analysis tests whether individuals who show stronger physiological responses to effort also show larger behavioral sensitivity changes.
